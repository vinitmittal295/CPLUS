shallow copy: it stores the reference of the object to the original memory address.
    what ever the changes we are performing are reflected back to the new object.
    stored the copy of the original object and point to the reference object
    Shallow copy is faster. data consistent.


Deep Copy:copies the object value, doesnot refelect the original changes. copies only the values
    hence if make any changes it wont refelect. compartively slower. data inconsistent
